# UrbanSetu

A full-stack real estate management application built with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) featuring both user and admin interfaces with admin approval system.

## Features

### User Features
- User registration and authentication
- Property browsing and search
- Property listings with detailed information
- Wishlist functionality
- Appointment booking with real estate agents
- Profile management
- Password change functionality

### Admin Features
- **Admin Approval System**: New admin signups require approval from the default admin only
- **Default Admin**: Pre-configured admin account with exclusive approval privileges
- Property management (create, edit, delete)
- Appointment management with status updates
- User management
- Admin dashboard with analytics
- Admin request management page (default admin only)

## Default Admin Account

The system includes a default admin account with exclusive privileges:

- **Email**: adminvijay@gmail.com
- **Password**: Salendra@2004
- **Status**: Pre-approved (no approval required)
- **Privileges**: Only this admin can approve new admin requests

### Setting up the Default Admin

After setting up your database, run the following command to create the default admin account:

```bash
npm run seed-admin
```

This will create the default admin account with pre-approved status and exclusive approval privileges.

## Admin Approval System

The application includes a secure admin approval system with exclusive default admin privileges:

### How it works:
1. **Default Admin**: The default admin (adminvijay@gmail.com) can sign in immediately and has exclusive approval privileges
2. **New Admin Registration**: When someone else signs up as an admin, their account is created with `adminApprovalStatus: "pending"`
3. **Approval Required**: Pending admins cannot sign in until approved by the default admin
4. **Exclusive Approval**: Only the default admin can view and approve/reject new admin requests
5. **Access Granted**: Only approved admins can access admin features (except approval functionality)

### Admin Request Flow:
1. User signs up as admin → Account created with pending status
2. User tries to sign in → Blocked with approval message
3. Default admin reviews request at `/admin/requests` (only visible to default admin)
4. Default admin approves/rejects the request
5. User can now sign in (if approved) or remains blocked (if rejected)

### Admin Privileges:
- **Default Admin (adminvijay@gmail.com)**:
  - Can approve/reject new admin requests
  - Has access to all admin functionality
  - Can manage properties, appointments, etc.
  - Exclusive access to admin approval system

- **Approved Admins**:
  - Can access all admin functionality except approval system
  - Cannot approve/reject new admin requests
  - Can manage properties, appointments, etc.
